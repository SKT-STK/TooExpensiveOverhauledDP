adds a new smithing template: "End Cleaner" which the player can use along side an Echo Shard to remove the repair cost from any iron, diamond & netherite equipment,
you can obtain said template by either cloning a Netherite Upgrade but with end_stone instead of netherrack, or by cloning itself just like you would with any other smithing template,

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
THIS DATAPACK HAS A CORRESPONDING RESOURCEPACK (TooExpensiveOverhauledRP)
